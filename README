NOTES:
<RANT>
Yeaaaa so this doesn't work.
Outstanding Issues:
On terminating of child, for whatever reason, I keep getting "Identifier removed". I checked msqid at the time of the system
so it's not that the msqid is going away. I think althrough I don't really know how to verify, for whatever reason, the
message queue itself is getting deleted which is weird since killing the children shouldn't affect the message queues.
1 possible way I tried to implement it is using the msgctl command with NULL in the 3rd argument in the child to get the children
to unattach from the message queues without deleting the message queue from the system but that didn't work.

On the possibility that it was a thundering herd issue, I tried releasing the children one by one but that didn't work.

In the children, I checked the msqid on msgrc and the msqid was the PID of the children which was REEAAAAALLLLY weird. IDK what this is,
I don't know how the children could possibly receive messages not meant for them if their pid parameter was correctly set to itself.

Deadlock detection algorithm seems to work fine though.
I'm just having problems with killing the children (as any honorable man would).

be gentle

The purpose of this project is to implement and use a deadlock detection algorithm.


The following are the user input parameters for this project:
-h "Help" Brings up user parameters for project
-n "proc" Total amount of children to be launched
-s "simul" Simultaneous amount of children that can be launched
-i "intervalInMsToLaunchChildren" The upper bound of a tie interval of which the parent will launch the children
-f "logfile" This input is the name of the logfile that you would like to write to. Add suffix ".txt" if you want file to be .txt file.



To compile the project. Enter "make" into the command line and run "./oss".

To clean files, enter "make clean" into the command line.
